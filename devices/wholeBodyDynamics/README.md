| HW_USE_MAS_IMU |  -  | group             | -     | -     | No       |  Group to enable attach to Multiple Analog Sensor interface based IMU. | If the group is not present, the default behavior of attaching to IGenericSensor interface IMU will be carried out. |

|                |   gyroscope   | string  | - | - | Yes    | Should match the sensor id used to open the device containing MAS IThreeAxisGyroscopes interface  |  |

  The axes contained in the `axesNames` parameter are then mapped to the wrapped `controlboard` in the `attachAll` method, using `controlBoardRemapper` class.
  Furthermore are also used to match the yarp axes to the joint names found in the passed URDF file.

#### Gravity Compensation
  This device also provides gravity compensation torques (using the `IImpedanceControl::setImpedanceOffset` method) for axis that are in compliant interaction mode and in position/position direct/velocity control mode.

This estimates are obtained just with the model, assuming that there is a link (the `gravityCompensationRootLink`) at which all external forces are exerted.

Typically this estimates are provided only for the upper joints (arms and torso) of the robots, as the gravity compensation terms for the legs depends on the support state of the robot.

 #### Secondary Calibration Matrix
  This device support to specify a secondary calibration matrix to apply on the top of the (already calibrated) measure coming from the F/T sensors.
  This feature is meant to be experimental, and will be removed at any time.

  The group of options that regulated this group is the following:
